This folder contains all the original source data for the project, including both spatial and tabular data. When you receive/obtain new data from a project, please follow these steps: 
1.	Within the “src” folder, create a folder named "from_[source]_[date]" (e.g., from_Canfor_15feb2025) and add the data you received inside of it. 
2.	Record the following details in the src_metadata.xlsx, 
o	A description of the data
o	Date accessed
o	Source (who provided it/where was it downloaded from) 
o	Path location where the data was saved
o	A brief explanation of why the data was provided (e.g., updated project boundary)
3.	Create a README.txt file within the folder containing the newly received data, including any relevant details. For instance, if the data was sent via email by a client, you could copy and paste the email content into the README.txt.
Note: This folder is intended to be read-only, meaning the source data/folder received from the client should remain intact and not be moved to other directories. For example, if you receive a model from a client and need to transfer it to the analysis folder, please create a copy instead of moving the original items.
