This folder contains analytical files that do not require version control or collaboration with the broader Meristem team. Files typically found here include:
•	Immediate model inputs or outputs
•	General analysis results or summaries
Any analysis products (.csv, .xlsx) that other team members need to work on should be saved in Teams. This folder is not for scripts or code; such files should be saved in the "git" folder, within the project repository for version control.
You are expected to create subfolders within the analysis folder to maintain organization. The subfolders you create can vary depending on the project’s type, objectives, and models used. Some examples of potential subfolders you should create include:
•	pw = Patchworks model inputs, outputs or summaries
•	ws = Woodstock model inputs, outputs or summaries
•	ntdn = Inputs, outputs, or summaries related to running a netdown
•	tipsy = Inputs, outputs, or summaries related to the TIPSY model
•	vdyp = Inputs, outputs, or summaries related to the VDYP model
