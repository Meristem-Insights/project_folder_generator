This folder contains project spatial files, including: 
•	Inputs and outputs to the resultant building process
•	Spatial data processing final and intermediate outputs 
•	Maps in .mxd, .qgz, .pdf or .jpg formats. 
You are expected to create subfolders within the gis folder to maintain organization. The subfolders you create can vary depending on the project’s type and objectives. Some examples of potential subfolders you should create include 
•	plots = Stores mapping-related layers, template, and GDBs, including maps for reports, presentations, etc., as well as generated graphs and plots.
•	overlays = Specific to the resultant building process. Contains a geodatabase (GDB) for the final resultant layers.
•	seamless = Specific to the resultant building process. Includes data.gdb, which holds processed spatial data to be incorporated into the final resultant. This primarily supports data processing and may contain additional GDBs for complex layers such as WHA or Cutblock processing.
Note: Original spatial data sources (e.g., .shp, .gdb, .kmz) received from clients, government portals, etc should be stored in the “src” folder.
